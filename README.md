## How to build and run this app
(source : https://developer.android.com/studio/run )

Android Studio sets up new projects to deploy to the Android Emulator or a connected device with just a few clicks. Once your app is installed, you can use [Apply Changes](https://developer.android.com/studio/run#apply-changes) to deploy certain code and resource changes without building a new APK.

To build and run your app, follow these steps:

1.  In the toolbar, select your app from the run configurations drop-down menu.
2.  From the target device drop-down menu, select the device that you want to run your app on.
    
   If you don't have any devices configured, then you need to either [connect a device via USB](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device#connect) or [create an AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd) to use the [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
    
3.  Click **Run** ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/buttons/toolbar-run.png).
